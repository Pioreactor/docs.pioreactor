:::tip Success goal

This experiment, at its core, will show the growth curves of algae over a 16h:8h day/night cycle. Students can observe exponential growth during the “day” hours, and stalled growth “overnight”.

## Requirements

* At least one available Pioreactor
* Algae
* Media for algae; for ex. Bold's Basal Medium (BBM)
* Two LED cables (supplied?) 

## Steps

1.	Attach two LED cables into channels C and D. 
2.	Insert the bulbs into the X2 and X3 pockets and secure them in place with the pocket caps. While on, some light leaking is acceptable. 
3.	Prepare a sterile stock of media for algae. We used Bold’s Basal Medium (BBM). Aim for approximately 14 mL of media per each vial/Pioreactor you will be using. 
4.	Add 1 mL of your algae culture to each vial. 
	*	Alternatively, you can separate one vial of algae culture between your Pioreactors. This is especially useful if your algae culture is particularly transparent.
5.	Wipe the vials and place them in the Pioreactor.
6.	Visit pioreactor.local and start a new experiment.
7.	On the left menu, select the Pioreactors page. Add any additional Pioreactors that you would like to use (more information here). Select Manage all Pioreactors, and start Stirring activity and OD reading activity.
	*	Optional: you can start the Temperature automation activity set on an optimal temperature. 
8.	Start the _LED automation_ at the bottom of the _Activities_ list in _Manage all Pioreactors_. This automation creates a day/night cycle ideal for algae growth (16 hours on, and 8 hours off). 
	*	Here, you can also set the intensities of the lightbulb. Note that a higher intensity would introduce heat. 
9.	Confirm that everything looks normal on the Overview page (ex: receiving optical density signal).
10.	Back on the Pioreactors page, select Manage all Pioreactors and start Growth rate. It will take a minute for results to begin showing up.
	*	Optional: you can change the names of the Pioreactor in the UI to display the target temperature.
11.	Students can watch growth progress on the Overview page.
