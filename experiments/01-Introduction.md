With your Pioreactor set up, you can now start a brand new experiment. Explore the sidebar for experiments you can perform with your Pioreactor.

One of the main datasets produced by the Pioreactor is implied growth rates. This rate is derived from the normalized optical density, and can give insight on the state of your culture under different external conditions.**

This graph can be interpreted in 4 phases:
* The lag phase: No observed growth, but high cell activity. In this stage, cells are in a nutrient rich environment and are preparing for growth by synthesizing proteins and other necessary molecules. 
* Exponential (or log) phase: Cells are now dividing and doubling in numbers after each generation time. Generation times are dependent on the species you are using for your experiment. 
* Stationary phase: Eventually the growth of cells reaches a plateau as nutrients are used up and waste products accumulate. At this point, the number of dividing cells will equal the number of dying cells.
* Decline (or death) phase: As nutrients are depleted, cell growth slows while cell death exponentially increases, resulting in a sharp decline.
