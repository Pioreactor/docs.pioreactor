With your Pioreactor set up, you can now start a brand new experiment. Explore the sidebar for experiments you can perform with your Pioreactor.

:::info
A key dataset produced by the Pioreactor is the _implied growth rate_ of the culture. You can find more information on interpreting this growth rate [here](/user-guide/od-normal-growth-rate#growth-rate).

Additionally, when working with small amounts of a microorganism, you can obtain more accurate growth rates by [blanking the vial](/user-guide/od-normal-growth-rate#blanking) before inoculation (Pioreactors tab > Calibrate > Blanks > Start, for each Pioreactor).
