Now that you've set up your Pioreactor, you can start a brand new experiment. Explore the sidebar for experiments you can perform with your Pioreactor. We encourage you to expand on the sample protocols we provided using your own cultures and media. 

:::info
A key dataset produced by the Pioreactor is the _implied growth rate_ of the culture. You can find more information on interpreting this growth rate [here](/user-guide/od-normal-growth-rate#growth-rate).

### Blanking

When working with **small amounts** of a microorganism, you can obtain more accurate growth rates by [blanking the vial](/user-guide/od-normal-growth-rate#blanking) before inoculation.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock images={["experiments/calibrate.png","experiments/blank.png"]}>

1. Insert your sterile vial containing media into the Pioreactor before inoculating with your species of interest.
2. On the website, click the _Pioreactors_ tab on the left-hand menu, and choose one of the active Pioreactors.
3. Select _Calibrate_, and under the _Blanks_ tab, click _Start_. The Pioreactor will now record the optical density of the blank vial.
4. Repeat for all the Pioreactors to be used. 
	*	A notification will appear when a Pioreactor has finished blanking. 
6. You can now inoculate your vials and begin your experiment.
