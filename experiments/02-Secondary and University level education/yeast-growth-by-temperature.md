:::tip Success Goal
Demonstrate the effect of temperature on yeast growth. Students may have a prior belief that temperature effects are linear, ex: a culture at 10℃ will grow at half the rate compared to a culture at 20℃, and a third the rate at 30℃. This experiment would show the non-linear effect of temperature on growth (and relate it to how refrigerators halt spoilage for so long). Students and the teacher can pick temperatures to test beforehand.

## Requirements

*   At least two available Pioreactors
*   Dry baker's yeast
*   YPD broth mix, or any other media mix

:::info
The Pioreactor doesn't cool samples, so it can't achieve temperatures below your ambient temperature. If you want to test low temperatures, you can place the Pioreactor in a fridge, or in a cooler with ice packs (making sure the electronics won't get wet).

## Steps (with images?)

1.  Prepare a sterile stock of 50g YPD / 1L distilled water. Aim to make 20ml × the number of Pioreactors you are using, as each Pioreactor will require about 15mL of media.
2.  Once stock is cool, inoculate the stock with a very small amount of baker's yeast using best practices to avoid other contamination. Wait for the yeast granules to dissolve, aided by gentle rocking or stirring.
> Alternatively, a yeast stock solution can be made by diluting (x) amount of yeast in 15mL of YPD stock media, then (1 drop/1mL) of this stock solution can be added to your vials.
3.  Mix well, and distribute up to 15mL of liquid into each clean and sterilized Pioreactor vial.
4.  Visit [pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) and start a new experiment.
5.  On the left menu, select the _Pioreactors_ page. Add any additional Pioreactors that you would like to use (more information [here](/user-guide/create-cluster)). Select _Manage all Pioreactors_, and start _Stirring_ activity, and _OD reading_ activity_._

6.  For each Pioreactor in use, select _Manage_ and start the _temperature automation_, select _Stable_ and provide the target temperature for that Pioreactor.
7.  Confirm that everything looks normal (ex: receiving optical density signal).
8.  Optional: you can change the names of the Pioreactor in the UI to display the target temperature. This can also be done at the start of your experiment.
9.  Students can watch growth progress on the _Overview_ page.
10.  After 24 or so hours (or even sooner in some cases),
    the students can explore maximum growth rates achieved, duration of lag phases, and overall yield of the cultures. 

## Summary? 

## Example

The following experiment was performed using four Pioreactors. Four vials containing 15 mL of the sterile YPD stock were inoculated with 1 drop of rehydrated active yeast (0.500 g of dry yeast in a 15mL YPD broth vial). They were subjected to different temperatures of 15°C, 26°C, 32°C and 38°C.

**Note**: The vial labeled _20C_ was cooled to approximately 15C using ice in a cooler. The Pioreactor was elevated to avoid contact with water.

Over the course of 18 hours, the following graphs were recorded:

The growth rate curves are observed to increase as temperatures increase. Vials at temperatures 32°C and 38°C exhibit similar growth curves. 

It is important to note that the normalized optical density of the 38°C vial approached a maximum of over 90, while the NOD of the 32°C vial approached 75. This is indicative of varying concentrations of yeast inoculant. (with lower concentrations of yeast in the 38°C vial, we can expect a steeper initial growth curve that peaks and tapers sooner than the curve generated by the 32°C vial).

32°C vial: Log phase begins at 2pm and continues until approximately 5pm. Growth rate peaks of **0.75 h⁻¹** at 5pm. 

26°C vial: Log phase is recorded until 6-7 pm and decline begins around 10pm. Peak growth rate is reported to be **0.50 h⁻¹** at 7pm.

15°C vial: Still in lag phase/entering log phase. Colder temperatures inhibit the growth of yeast such that no curve was observed in this time frame.
