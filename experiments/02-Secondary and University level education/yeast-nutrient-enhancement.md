:::tip Success goal
Brewers wort is a sugary liquid extracted from the mashing process when making beer or whiskey. It contains vitamins and minerals necessary for yeast growth; yeast cells uptake these nutrients to produce proteins such as growth enzymes. Wort can be further supplemented with additional nutrients to enhance this growth &#151 a main supplement being Yeast Lightning. The one we have is designed for beer yeasts.

## Requirements

*   Two available Pioreactors
*   Dry baker's yeast
*   Dry malt extract (DME) 
*	Yeast Lightning
*	Scale (accurate to 0.1)

## Steps

1.  Rehydrate the DME powder using distilled water. Use 3.2 grams of DME powder in 30 mL of water (two vials).
 
4.  Visit [pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) and start a new experiment.
5.  On the left menu, select the _Pioreactors_ page. Add any additional Pioreactors that you would like to use (more information [here](/user-guide/create-cluster)). Select _Manage all Pioreactors_, and start _Stirring_ activity, and _OD reading_ activity.
6.  For each Pioreactor in use, select _Manage_ and start the _temperature automation_, select _Stable_ and provide the target temperature for that Pioreactor.
7.  Confirm that everything looks normal on the _Overview_ page (ex: receiving optical density signal).
8.  Optional: you can change the names of the Pioreactor in the UI to display the target temperature. This can also be done at the start of your experiment.
9.	Back on the _Pioreactors_ page, select _Manage all Pioreactors_ and start _Growth rate_. It will take a minute for results to begin showing up. 
10.  Students can watch growth progress on the _Overview_ page.
11.  After 24 or so hours (or even sooner in some cases),
