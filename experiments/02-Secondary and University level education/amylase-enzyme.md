title: Starch digestion using amylase
slug: /amylase-enzyme

:::tip Success Goal
Explore the enzymatic activity of amylase as it breaks down starch (a complex carbohydrate) into simple sugars. Amylase is an enzyme derived from a variety of living-sources. A starch slurry (a combination of water and starch) can be created and the addition of amylase will convert the starch into glucose, resulting in a translucent sugar water. Concentrations and effects of inhibitors can be explored. In this example, we will use black tea.
