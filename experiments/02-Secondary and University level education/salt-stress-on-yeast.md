title: Osmotic pressure induced by salt
slug: /salt-stress-on-yeast
---

:::tip Success Goal
Observe differences yeast cell viability by introducing osmotic pressures with increasing salt concentrations. This experiment explores the topic of hypo- and hypertonicity. Salty environments create osmotic pressure gradients across the cell membrane. This introduces cellular stress, resulting in differences in cell growth rates.

## Requirements

*	At least two available Pioreactors
*	Dry baker's yeast
*   YPD broth mix, or any other media mix
*	Table salt 
*	Scale (accurate to 0.1)

## Steps

1.  Prepare a sterile stock of 50g YPD / 1L distilled water. Aim to make 20ml × the number of Pioreactors you are using, as each Pioreactor will require about 15mL of media.
2.  Weigh table salt to add to your media. 
A sample calculation is as follows:
To create a salt concentration of **2% w/v** for **15 mL** of media, multiply 0.02 (or 2%) by 15 mL. 
Therefore, **0.3g** of table salt is needed.
3. Once stock is cool, divide the stock into the sterilized vials and add salt. You can mix the salt with gentle shaking or by using the stirring function on the Pioreactor. 
4. When the salt is diluted into the media, inoculate the stock with a very small amount of baker's yeast using best practices to avoid other contamination. Wait for the yeast granules to dissolve, aided by gentle rocking or stirring.
6.  Visit [pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) and start a new experiment.
7.  On the left menu, select the _Pioreactors_ page. Add any additional Pioreactors that you would like to use (more information [here](/user-guide/create-cluster)). Select _Manage all Pioreactors_, and start _Stirring_ activity and _OD reading_ activity_._ Optionally, you can  start the _Temperature automation_ activity set on an optimal temperature.
8.  Confirm that everything looks normal (ex: receiving optical density signal).
10.  Optional: you can change the names of the Pioreactor in the UI to display the target temperature.
11.  Students can watch growth progress on the _Overview_ page.
12.  After 24 or so hours (even sooner in some cases),
    the students can explore maximum growth rates achieved, duration of lag phases, and overall yield of the cultures. 


## Example

We replicated this experiment using four Pioreactors and vials containing 15 mL of sterile YPD stock and salt concentrations of 0%, 2%, 4%, and 6% w/v. By grams, 0g, 0.3g, 0.6g, and 0.9g of table salt were added to each vial, repectively. They were then innoculated with one drop of rehydrated active yeast (0.500 g of dry yeast in a 15 mL YPD broth vial). The _Temperature automation_ was set on _Stable_ at 30°C. 

After approximately 20 hours, the following implied growth rates were recorded:

## Interpretation (to be edited) 

The optimal growth condition occurs at 0% salt w/v (no salt stress). A spike in 2% salt w/v growth rate is observed at approximately 9pm. This can be indicative of adaptation of the yeast to the higher salt content after a lag phase.
