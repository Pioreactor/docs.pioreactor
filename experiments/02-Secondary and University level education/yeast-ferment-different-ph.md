:::tip Success Goal 
Demonstrate how environmental pH levels can affect the growth rate of yeast. Students can explore pH scales and how this relates to the process of fermentation, which is the process in which microorganisms (like yeast) break down sugars into energy sources for its own use. Changes in pH can ultimately affect the growth ability of yeast. Baker’s yeast thrives in a pH range of 4 to 6, and growth can be inhibited in pH levels outside this range. Students can explore differences in yeast growth by adjusting the initial pH levels with an acid or base, and monitoring the growth rates using the Pioreactor.

## Requirements

*   At least two available Pioreactors
*   Dry baker's yeast
*   YPD broth mix, or any other media mix
*	Dilute? HCl and/or NaOH to adjust the pH of the media
*	A pH meter or pH strips 

## Steps

1.  Prepare a sterile stock of 50g YPD / 1L distilled water. Aim to make 20ml × the number of Pioreactors you are using, as each Pioreactor will require about 15mL of media.
2.  Prepare 1 N of HCl and 1 N of NaOH using the following proportions: 
* For 1N of HCl, combine 36.5g HCl per 1L distilled water.
* For 1N of NaOH, combine 40g NaOH per 1L distilled water. 
3. Once stock is cool, divide the stock into different beakers to adjust the pH. Using a pH meter or strips, adjust the pH of separate beakers until the desired pH is reached. For example, after dividing the sterile stock into three beakers, each can be adjusted to pH levels of 4 (by adding drops of 1N HCl), 7, and 9 (by adding drops of 1N NaOH), respectively. 
4. Inoculate the stock with a very small amount of baker's yeast using best practices to avoid other contamination. Wait for the yeast granules to dissolve, aided by gentle rocking or stirring.
5.  Mix well, and distribute up to 15mL of liquid to clean and sterilized Pioreactor vials.
6.  Visit [pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) and start a new experiment.
7.  On the left menu, select the _Pioreactors_ page. Add any additional Pioreactors that you would like to use (more information [here](/user-guide/create-cluster)). Select _Manage all Pioreactors_, and start _Stirring_ activity, _Temperature automation_ activity and _OD reading_ activity_._
8.  Confirm that everything looks normal (ex: receiving optical density signal).
10.  Optional: you can change the names of the Pioreactor in the UI to display the target temperature.
11.  Students can watch growth progress on the _Overview_ page.
12.  After 24 or so hours (even sooner in some cases),
    the students can explore maximum growth rates achieved, duration of lag phases, and overall yield of the cultures. Plotting these metrics vs pH levels can give students an intuition about how acidity affects yeast growth.
