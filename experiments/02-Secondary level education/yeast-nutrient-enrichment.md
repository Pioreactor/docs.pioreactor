:::tip Success goal
Brewers wort is a sugary liquid extracted from the mashing process when making beer or whiskey. It contains vitamins and minerals necessary for yeast growth; yeast cells uptake these nutrients to produce proteins such as growth enzymes. Wort can be further supplemented with additional nutrients to enhance this growth. The one we have is designed for beer yeasts.

## Requirements

*   Two available Pioreactors
*   Dry baker's yeast
*   Dry malt extract (DME) 
*	Yeast nutrients (Yeast Lightning) 
*	Scale (accurate to 0.1)

## Steps

1.  Rehydrate the DME powder using distilled water. Use 3.2 grams of DME powder in 30 mL of water (two vials).
2.	Pour 15 mL into one vial. 
3.	Add (a pinch) of Yeast Lightning to the remaining DME mixture. Add this to the second vial.  
4.	Inoculate the stock with a very small amount of baker's yeast using best practices to avoid other contamination. Wait for the yeast granules to dissolve, aided by gentle rocking or stirring.
	* Alternatively, a yeast stock solution can be made by diluting a small amount of yeast in 15 mL of YPD stock, then 1 drop of this stock solution can be added to your vials.
5.  Wipe the vials and place them in the Pioreactors. 
6.  Visit [pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) and start a new experiment.
7.  On the left menu, select the _Pioreactors_ page. Add any additional Pioreactors that you would like to use (more information [here](/user-guide/create-cluster)). Select _Manage all Pioreactors_, and start _Stirring_ activity, and _OD reading_ activity.
8.	Optional: you can turn on the Temperature automation activity and set it on _Stable_ at an optimal temperature (ex. 30C). 
9.  Confirm that everything looks normal on the _Overview_ page (ex: receiving optical density signal).
10.  Optional: you can change the names of the Pioreactor in the UI to display DME with/without Yeast Lightning (YL). 
11.	Back on the _Pioreactors_ page, select _Manage all Pioreactors_ and start _Growth rate_. It will take a minute for results to begin showing up. 
12.  Students can watch growth progress on the _Overview_ page.
13.  After 24 or so hours (or even sooner in some cases), students can observe if the addition of Yeast Lightning has increased the growth of yeast in rehydrated DME.
