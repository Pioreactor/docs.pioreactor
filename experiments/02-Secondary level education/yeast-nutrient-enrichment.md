:::tip Success goal
Dried malt extract, or DME, is a precursor used in beer production.  + YL or just DME in a turbidostat system.

## Requirements

*   Two available Pioreactors
*   Dry baker's yeast
*	YPD media
*	Yeast nutrients (Yeast Lightning) 
*	Scale (accurate to 0.1)
*	Four peristaltic pumps: 
	*	One media pump
	*	One nutrient pump
	*	Two waste pumps
*	Three liquid containers:
	*	One labelled "media"
	*	One labelled "nutrients"
	*	One labelled "waste"

## Detailed procedure

1. Add media into your media container. Sterilize by autoclaving.
2. Adjust the tube lengths on the cap of your small sterile vial such that one just touches the media, while another sits above the media.
3. Inoculate your small sterile vial with drops of your culture. 
4. Wipe vial and place in the Pioreactor. 
5. For your media pump:
	*	Attach the source tube to your media container. 
	*	Attach the sink tube to the vial cap tube that sits **above** the media. 
6. For your waste pump:
	*	Attach the source tube to the vial cap tube that **touches** the media. 
7. For your alternative media pump: ******
8.	Visit [pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) and start a new experiment.
9.  On the left menu, select the _Pioreactors_ page. Add the additional Pioreactor (more information [here](/user-guide/create-cluster)). 
10.	Select _Manage all Pioreactors_, and start _Stirring_ activity and _OD reading_ activity.
11.	Confirm everything looks correct, then start the _Growth rate_ activity for all Pioreactors. 
12.	Start separate _Dosing automation_ for both Pioreactors. 
13. Change automation to _Turbidostat_. Set your _Volume_ and _Target OD_. 
14. You can change the parameters of the turbidostat automation in the _Settings_ tab. Changes will take effect immediately.
