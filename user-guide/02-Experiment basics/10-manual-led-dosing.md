### Dosing

You can manual dose from the Pioreactor UI. These are NOT automations, but rather simple commands to use to set up an experiment, or perform cleaning.

Under the _Dosing_ tab, you activate the media pump or the alt-media pump _and concurrently the waste pump_. This is called _cycling_. By running the waste pump simultaneously, the vial will avoids being overflowed. You can cycle for a set duration of time.

You can also run specific pumps (media, waste, and alt-media) for specific durations, volumes (if calibrated), or continuously. The latter will run until the Stop button it pressed.

:::caution
Careful not to overflow your vial! The vial can hold 20ml, but stay well below this.
