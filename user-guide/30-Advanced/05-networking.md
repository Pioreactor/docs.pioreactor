Previously, Raspberry Pis used a file called `wpa_supplicant.conf` to handle wifi network connections. **This is not longer the case**. Modern Raspberry Pi software, including the Pioreactor, doesn't use `wpa_supplicant.conf` at all. Instead, the tool `nmcli` replaces it. Don't follow tutorials that use `wpa_supplicant.conf`.

## General networking tools

### Connecting to a wifi network using `nmcli`


You can first discover all the visible networks with:

```
sudo nmcli d wifi list
```

If you see your network on the list, then run:


```
sudo nmcli device wifi connect <ssid name> password <ssid password> ifname wlan0
```

(If you get a "Can't find" error, try running the above `list` command again.)

### Connecting to multiple networks

First, some terminology and understanding for us: a computer, like a Pi, has networking interfaces. For example, the onboard wifi on RPiâ€™s is one such interface. The larger, model Bs, have an ethernet connector, which is another interface. Each interface can connect to 0 or 1 networks.

In order to connect to multiple networks, you need a Raspberry Pi with multiple interfaces. You can add interfaces with devices like a [USB wifi device](https://forum.pioreactor.com/t/connecting-more-workers-to-cluster/330/3).

To see what your current interfaces are doing, use:
```
nmcli device
```

The right hand side shows your connected interfaces. For example, if have a ethernet connection to a router, you'll see an `eth0` connection active. If you have an additional wifi hardware device attached to your Pi, you'll see `wlan1`.

To connect to another wifi network using `wlan1`, use:

```
sudo nmcli device wifi connect <ssid name> password <ssid password> ifname wlan1
```

If your leader is connected to multiple networks `A` and `B`, and you access the UI over network `A`, but your workers access over network `B`, the leader is in the position called a "gateway". You'll need to make some configuration changes to your cluster. Since the leader is attached to networks `A` and `B`, it has two IPs (use `hostname -I` to see all the ips), let's call them `ipA` and `ipB` respectively.

1. Access the configuration in the UI.
2. In the _shared_ config.ini, edit the `[mqtt]` `broker` field to be equal to `ipA`. Also edit the `leader_address` to be `ipB`.
3. In each of the workers (including the leader's config.ini, if it's a worker), add the following:
   ```
   [mqtt]
   broker=ipB
   ```

You may need to restart your cluster for these to take full effect.



### Starting the [Pioreactor local access](/user-guide/local-access-point) point using `nmcli`

Note that you can only have 1 network connection for each network interface. So if you have only 1 wifi device (by default, RPi's only have 1 wifi device on them -> only 1 wifi interface), the following will replace any existing wifi connection.

```
sudo nmcli con up PioreactorAP
```


#### Setting `leader_address` and MQTT `broker` in your config.ini


### Changing web UI port from `80` to something else

To change the web UI port from the default of `80`, following these instructions:

1. SSH into your leader Pioreactor.
2. We'll edit the lighttpd configuration first: 
   ```
   sudo nano /etc/lighttpd/lighttpd.conf
   ```

   and find the line starting with `server.port`. Change this to something else (preferably not a value below 1024). Save and exit.

3. Restart lighttpd with:
   ```
   sudo systemctl restart lighttpd.service
   ```
   You should be able to access the web UI only on http://`leader name`:`new port`, for example: http://leader.local:8080

4. In your configuration, under the `[ui]` section, change the `port` option from `80` to your new port value. Save. You may need to restart your cluster for this new port to propagate to all machines correctly. 


## Connecting to eduroam

This is a work-in-progress, but here's [one example](https://forum.pioreactor.com/t/connecting-more-workers-to-cluster/330/3#connecting-to-eduroam-2).
