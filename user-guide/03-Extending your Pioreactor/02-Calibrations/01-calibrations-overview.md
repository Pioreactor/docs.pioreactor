Calibrations help your Pioreactor translate raw device readings into accurate, experiment-ready values. Run or update calibrations when you change hardware, media, optics, or anything that can shift measurements.

Start with the calibration that matches what you are working on:

- Hardware devices like stirring and pumps: [Hardware calibrations](/user-guide/hardware-calibrations)
- Optical density standard curves: [Standard curves for OD600 readings](/user-guide/calibrate-od600)

When you are done calibrating, pick which curve is active and keep your records organized in the UI or CLI. See [Managing calibrations](/user-guide/managing-calibrations).
