The Pioreactor comes with a large set of functionality and behaviour to accomplish most projects. For example, continuous culturing, optical density reading, and stable temperatures are available out-of-the-box. However, the specifics and range of how people use bioreactors goes far beyond what we could ever cover. That's why Pioreactor has added a platform so that community members can make their own extensions and share them with others. We call these _plugins._ (Below is how to install plugins - if you are looking to create your own plugins, see [here](/developer-guide/plugin-as-python-package).)

## Installing plugins

From your Pioreactor's interface, the "Plugins" button on the left navigation bar will display all your currently installed plugins, and available plugins from the community.

### Custom automations

After installation, custom dosing, LED, or temperature automations will be available in the automation modal under the "Settings" tab in each Pioreactor's Manage modal.

### Custom activities

After installation, a custom activity's state and settings will show up on each Pioreactor's card. Below, we've installed the pioreactor-air-bubbler plugin:

Managing on/off and settings are done just like any other job, in the Manage modal:

## Alternative: putting Python files in the the `plugins` folder

An alternative way to install a plugin is to place a Python file in the `/home/pioreactor/.pioreactor/plugins` directory on the Raspberry Pi. This is good for one-off scripts or plugins you are demoing or testing.
