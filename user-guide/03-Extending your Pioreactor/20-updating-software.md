We publish new software occasionally that fixes bugs, adds new features, and improves performance. You can update your Pioreactor(s) to the latest software from the UI. **We highly recommend keeping your Pioreactor software up to date!**

### How to update your software

First, when a new software version is released by our team, you will see a red "badge" in your UI's sidebar:

![a red badge is beside the Update link](/img/user-guide/badge.png)

Upon visiting the _Updates_ page, you can see what version you have installed, and the latest version published by us. You can also read the changelog to see what improvements we've made in the latest releases.

If you'd like to update, click on the "Update to latest release" button. Updating software doesn't interrupt experiments or activities, but we suggest waiting until between experiments to update.

### Installing previous versions or development versions

From the [command line](https://docs.pioreactor.com/user-guide/accessing-raspberry-pi), you can install specific versions. See `pio update app --help` for more.
