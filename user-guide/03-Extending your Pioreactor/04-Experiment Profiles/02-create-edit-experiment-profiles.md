### Using the UI

Starting in version 23.9.x, we introduced a new way to create and edit experiment profiles. Experiment profiles can now be managed in the UI at `/experiment-profiles`. See video below for a demonstration.

### On the command line

All profiles are stored on the leader's disk under `~/.pioreactor/experiment_profiles/`. You can create and edit profiles here, as well.
