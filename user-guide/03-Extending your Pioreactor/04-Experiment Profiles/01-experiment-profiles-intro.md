Experiment profiles are another way to automatically control your Pioreactor(s). Think of them as "scripts" (in the "movie script" sense) that you can write, and the Pioreactor will perform. For example, you can use experiment profiles to automatically start stirring and start temperature control when an experiment begins, and then automatically turn off stirring and temperature control hours later. They can be used to update activity settings, without you needing to be around. We think of them as "clicking in the UI without, but headless".
