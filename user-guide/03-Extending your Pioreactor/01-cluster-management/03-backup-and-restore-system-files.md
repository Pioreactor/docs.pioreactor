Each Pioreactor keeps its configuration, calibration data, and persistent state inside `~/.pioreactor`. The Inventory page now lets you export that directory as a system archive (`.zip`) for safekeeping and import it onto the same unit when you need to restore or clone a setup.

## Exporting a system archive

1. Open the **Inventory** page, find the Pioreactor you want to back up, and click **Manage Pioreactor → Export system archive**.
2. Review the dialog and click **Export** when ready. The UI downloads a file named `<pioreactor>_dot_pioreactor.zip`.
3. Store the archive somewhere safe. It contains every file from that unit’s `~/.pioreactor` plus a `pioreactor_export_metadata.json` descriptor (hostname, version, export time).

After you confirm, the browser saves a zip named `<pioreactor>_dot_pioreactor.zip`.

#### Troubleshooting
- If export is blocked, check whether the unit has the sentinel file `~/.pioreactor/DISALLOW_UI_FILE_SYSTEM`; removing it re-enables downloads.
- Since the export is over http, you may need to "approve" your browser to download it (check the download tab in your browser).
- For the leader Pioreactor, it's also exporting the sqlite database. This might take a while for very large databases.

## Importing a system archive

Use imports when you need to restore a backup, duplicate a Pioreactor after replacing hardware, or bring back calibration data after re-flashing an SD card.

1. On the **Inventory** page, choose **Manage Pioreactor → Import system archive**.
2. Read the warning and click **Select system archive file**, then pick a `.zip` generated by the export flow.
3. Wait for confirmation in the snackbar. The UI shows a spinner while uploading and tells you when the Pioreactor begins rebooting.

:::danger Important
Importing wipes the existing `~/.pioreactor` on that unit before restoring the archive, so anything not inside the uploaded zip is permanently removed.

Important behaviour to note:

- Hostnames must match. The worker compares the archive metadata to the target unit name and rejects mismatches during import.
- The ZIP is validated to block absolute paths, symlinks, or other unsafe entries before anything is extracted.
- An automatic backup of the existing `~/.pioreactor` is written to `/tmp/<hostname>_dot_pioreactor_backup_<timestamp>` before any files are replaced. You can manually restore from that folder if you need to undo the import.
- After the files are moved into place, the worker schedules a reboot so the new configuration takes effect.
- Imports and exports share the same guard: adding `~/.pioreactor/DISALLOW_UI_FILE_SYSTEM` disables both operations until the file is removed.

## Advanced notes

- For scripted workflows you can hit `/api/units/$broadcast/zipped_dot_pioreactor` to download archives for every worker in one request. The aggregated ZIP namespaces each unit under a folder that matches its hostname.
- Imports are always per-unit. If you are automating restores, loop over your hosts and POST the zip to `/api/units/<pioreactor>/import_zipped_dot_pioreactor` one at a time.

With these tools you can keep regular snapshots of your cluster, move calibrations between identical builds, or roll back quickly after testing changes.
