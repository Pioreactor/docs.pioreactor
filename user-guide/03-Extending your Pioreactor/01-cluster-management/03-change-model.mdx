## Update a Pioreactor's model from the UI

You can update the model that the software uses for each unit from the **Inventory** page.

1. Navigate to **Inventory** in the sidebar.
2. Locate the Pioreactor you want to configure and open the **Model** dropdown.
3. Pick the correct entry. The change is saved immediately.

Changes to the model update any UI text, configuration safety limits, and workflows that depend on vessel geometry.

## Add a custom model

The UI lists every YAML definition stored in `.pioreactor/models/`. Each file represents a single model.

1. Create the directory if it does not already exist:

   ```bash
   mkdir -p ~/.pioreactor/models
   ```

2. Add a new YAML file. Use a descriptive file name such as `my_custom_model.yaml`.

   ```yaml
   model_name: custom_100ml
   model_version: "1.0"
   display_name: "Custom 100 mL, v1.0"
   reactor_capacity_ml: 100.0
   reactor_max_fill_volume_ml: 95.0
   reactor_diameter_mm: 50.0
   max_temp_to_reduce_heating: 80.0
   max_temp_to_disable_heating: 85.0
   max_temp_to_shutdown: 90.0
   ```

### Required fields

| Field | Description |
| --- | --- |
| `model_name` | A unique identifier. Use lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores. Example `pioreactor_20ml` |
| `model_version` | Semantic version string that differentiates variants of the same model. Example: `1.1` |
| `display_name` | What appears in the UI dropdown. Example: `Pioreactor 20ml, v1.1`|
| Capacity and geometry fields | Used by dosing and safety calculations. Provide real measurements in millilitres and millimetres. |
| Temperature limits | Guardrails for the heater. Adjust them to match your hardware. |

If any field fails validation, the Pioreactor logs an error in `pioreactor.log` and skips the file. Double-check spelling and numeric values if your model does not appear.

### Reload the web UI

After adding or editing model files, restart the web UI service so it picks up the new definitions:

```bash
sudo systemctl restart pioreactor-web.target
```

Return to the Inventory page and reopen the **Model** dropdown. Your custom entry should now be available alongside the built-in models.

## Troubleshooting

- **No new dropdown entries:** confirm the YAML file lives in `/home/pioreactor/.pioreactor/models/` on the leader and that the file extension is `.yaml` or `.yml`. Restart the `pioreactor-web.target` service once more.
- **Validation errors in the logs:** open `pioreactor.log` or run `journalctl -u pioreactor-web.target` to view the message, then update the YAML file accordingly.
- **Distribute to workers**: workers need these files to, so if you've added it to your leader, you can run `pios cp ~/.pioreactor/models/my_custom_model.yaml` to distribute it to workers.
- **Hardware directory in sync:** if your hardware definitions live outside the default location, update the contents of `$DOT_PIOREACTOR/hardware/` (typically `~/.pioreactor/hardware/`) so every unit uses the same model metadata.
