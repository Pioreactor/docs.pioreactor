### Before you begin

You can expect the setup process to take 10-15 minutes. If you encounter any problems, feel free to email us for support at hello@pioreactor.com.


:::info

Before you get started, you'll need to have the following:

1.  A Raspberry Pi (our list of recommended Raspberry Pis is [here](/user-guide/common-questions#what-raspberry-pi-hardware-can-i-use-i-see-raspberry-pi-1-2-3-4-a-b--zero---its-confusing))
2.  A blank microSD card (our recommended microSD cards is [here](/user-guide/common-questions#what-microsd-cards-do-you-recommend))
3.  A suitable power supply for the Raspberry Pi (our recommended power supply units are [here](/user-guide/common-questions#what-power-supply-unit-do-i-need))
4.  A computer with internet access and ability to read & write to a microSD card

:::

### Setting up your Raspberry Pi


We'll start your blank microSD card.

1. Download the [Pioreactor leader & worker image file](https://github.com/pioreactor/custopizer/releases/latest/download/pioreactor_leader_worker.zip).

:::info
What is an image file? It's a file that contains all the required software preinstalled on it, including an operating system and our custom Pioreactor software. The image will be installed on the microSD card.
:::

2.  Download the latest version of [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) for your operating system and install it.
3.  Open the newly-installed Raspberry Pi Imager.
3.  Click **Choose Device**, and select your Raspberry Pi model.
    ![Click "Choose Device"](/img/user-guide/choose_device.png)
3.  Click **Choose OS**. Click on **Use custom** towards the bottom:
    ![Click "Choose OS"](/img/user-guide/choose-os.png)
    ![Select the "Use custom" option](/img/user-guide/use_custom_image.png)
    Select the downloaded Pioreactor image from step 1.
	
    <img src="/img/user-guide/select_new_image.png" alt="Screenshot of the local computer's directory, selecting the downloaded image" width="555" style={{margin: "auto", display:"block"}} />


4. Insert your microSD card to your computer. After your microSD card is recognized by your computer, click **Choose Storage** and select it.
    ![Click "Choose storage"](/img/user-guide/choose-storage.png)
5. Click **Next**.
	![Click Next](/img/user-guide/choose-next.png)
6. Click **Edit settings**:
    <img src="/img/user-guide/choose-edit-settings.png" width="525" alt="Click edit settings" style={{margin: "auto", display:"block"}} />

    1. Check **Set hostname**. Input a unique name for this Pioreactor. Some names that we use for our first Pioreactor: `pioreactor1`, or `leader`, or `pio1`. _Don't_ use `pioreactor`.
    3. Check **Set username and password**. Enter the following:
        -   **username**: `pioreactor`
        -   **password**: `raspberry`.
        -   Note: You can change the username and password later.
    4. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your network name into SSID network name, WiFi password, and country. Or leave blank if using ethernet,
	:::tip
    If you are having difficulty connecting to a network, like at a university that may not easily allow Raspberry Pi's, [there's a built-in solution for creating a local access point](/user-guide/local-access-point)).
	:::
	
    5. Change timezone to your local timezone.
    6. Under the "Services" tab, check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.

    Your settings should look something like this:

    <img src="/img/user-guide/rpi-imager-settings.png" width="625" alt="Screenshot of what your settings should look like" style={{margin: "auto", display:"block"}} />

    <img src="/img/user-guide/rpi-imager-settings-2.png" width="625" alt="Screenshot of what your settings should look like" style={{margin: "auto", display:"block"}} />

    6.  Click **Save** to save and exit the dialog box.

7. Click "Yes" to begin writing. A prompt *may* appear asking for permission to write, accept it. Writing will take up to 5 minutes. Perfect time for a tea break.
7.  Once writing is complete, remove the microSD card, and place it (exposed copper side up) into the Raspberry Pi. **Your Raspberry Pi's power should be unplugged before inserting the microSD card**. The microSD slot is located on the PWM side of the Pioreactor, in the gap between the Raspberry Pi and the bottom faceplate. Reference the picture for the orientation.

    ![Insert the microSD card](/img/user-guide/place-micro-sd-card.JPG)

8.  Plug power into your Raspberry Pi. LEDs onboard the Raspberry Pi may start to light up. After **a few minutes**, your Pioreactor HAT will briefly blink a blue LED, telling us it is ready.

      <source src="/vid/flashing.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>
</p>

:::info
Waited, but didn't see a blue LED blink, or maybe you missed it? Try pressing on the onboard button, near the side labelled "PWM", and pictured above. If this lights up the blue LED, you're good to move on. Still not working? Try power-cycling the Raspberry Pi, or email us at hello@pioreactor.com.
:::

9. After observing the blue LED flashing, navigate to [http://pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) in a web browser to visit the web interface. If you are using local-access-point, looking for a `pioreactor` wifi network and then visit the link. (Not able to load http://pioreactor.local? Read [Troubleshooting](#pioreactorlocal-in-a-web-browser-is-not-showing-up) below).
10. The Pioreactor is now ready for use! Follow [this guide](/user-guide/prepare-vial-for-cultures) to set up your first experiment.

## Adding additional workers to your cluster

Workers are additional Pioreactors that you can control from a single UI. Together, a leader and workers form a Pioreactor cluster.

#### Step 1. Install the worker software

1. Follow the same instructions above, but use a [Pioreactor Worker image](https://github.com/pioreactor/custopizer/releases/latest/download/pioreactor_worker.zip) instead. All the settings are the same, including *username* and *password*, **but choose a new hostname**. See note below:

:::note 
Choose a hostname that isn't currently being used in your cluster, ex: `worker1`, `worker2`, etc.
:::

Below is a screenshot of example settings, your settings might be slightly different.


<img src="/img/user-guide/rpi-imager-settings-worker.png" width="625" alt="Screenshot of what your settings should look like" style={{margin: "auto", display:"block"}} />


2. After the image is written to the microSD card, place the microSD card into the Raspberry Pi and power it on. The Pioreactor's blue LED won't blink, as it's not 100% ready yet.

3. After a few minutes, connect the new Pioreactor worker to your cluster using the UI. See next steps.

#### Step 2. Add worker to cluster using the UI

On the _Pioreactors_ page in the web interface, click the "Add new Pioreactor" button in the top right:

![Add new pioreactor](/img/user-guide/add_new_pioreactor.png)

Provide the chosen hostname of the new worker Pioreactor:

![Add new pioreactor modal](/img/user-guide/add_new_pioreactor_modal.png)


After a minute, the new Pioreactor should appear on the _Pioreactors_ and _Experiment Overview_ page. Refresh the page if it does not show up. Your new Pioreactor will also blink its blue LED.


#### From the command line _(Alternative)_

On the leader's command line, the command `pio add-pioreactor <new name>` will connect the new Pioreactor to the cluster.

:::tip
We recommend running a [self-test](/user-guide/running-self-test) on all Pioreactors after your initial setup to detect any hardware bugs at this point.

## Troubleshooting

#### My Leader Pioreactor never flashes the blue LED
 - First, confirm that when you press the HAT button, the blue LED does not show up. If it does, you're good to go.
 - It's likely that the installation failed (due to a settings issue), or there is a problem with the SD card. Double check the settings that you used and try reinstalling the image.
 - Are you using a microSD card with size *larger* than 32GB? You may need to reformat it to FAT32. To do this, in the Rasbperry Pi Imager, first select "Erase: format card as FAT32" under "Choose OS". Then proceed with writing the image.


#### My Pioreactor keeps flashing the blue LED
On a successful start, the Pioreactor will flash its blue LED for about 2 seconds. If you observe the blue LED flashing for longer, something may be wrong. You can diagnose the problem by [counting the number of flashes observed](/user-guide/error-codes).


#### My RPi won't connect to my WiFi.

*   Some Raspberry Pis can't connect to Wifi natively, and some Raspberry Pis can only connect to 2.4GHz connections. See table below: [![Rpi and wifi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)[](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)
*   If you are using the built-in WiFi in a Raspberry Pi3, a Pi3B+, or Pi Zero W, be aware that the signal strength from the tiny internal antenna may be weaker than other WiFi devices. Try moving your Pioreactor closer to the router as a test.
*   If your network hidden? You will need to check `hidden SSID` in the configuration in the Raspberry Pi imager. To fix this, you'll need to restart the image installation from the Raspberry Pi Imager.
*   Try power-cycling the Raspberry Pi (unplug and plug back in).
*   If you are on a restrictive network (like at a university), and wish to avoid the network, [creating a local access point](/user-guide/local-access-point) may be a better option.
*   You may have mis-typed your WiFi credentials. To fix this, you'll need to restart the image installation from the Raspberry Pi Imager.
*   If connecting to a 5GHz WiFi connection, you _need_ to supply a valid country code. See the list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-2/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 "Link to country codes on wikipedia")
*   It's possible your SD card is damaged. This can cause all sorts of problems (including failing to boot), not just WiFi issues. The most common cause of SD card failure is probably inserting or removing the SD card while the Pi is powered up.
*   Check out some other possibilities [here](https://community.octoprint.org/t/wifi-setup-and-troubleshooting/184#heading--troubleshooting).


#### I want to change the Pioreactor name on installation of leader

Easiest solution is to start over. You can edit the name in the RPi Imager, and reflash the image onto the microSD card to remove all previous data.

#### pioreactor.local in a web browser is not showing up

*   In your browser's address bar, add the `http://` in front of the url, like so: `http://pioreactor.local`.
*   Try appending a backslash as well: `http://pioreactor.local/`
*   The UI is hosted on **http**, not **http_s_**. Check if you are accessing `http` `://pioreactor.local`, and _not_ `https` `://pioreactor.local`.
*   Try accessing using the url `http://<the permanent name of your Pioreactor aka hostname>.local`
*   If you know your Raspberry Pi's IP, try `http://<IP address of your Raspberry Pi>`. Here's [information to determine the IP address](/user-guide/common-questions#how-can-i-determine-the-pioreactors-ip-address)
*   When pressing the button on the HAT, does the blue LED show up? If not, installation may have failed. Try installing the image again, and double check the settings.
*   Try power-cycling the Raspberry Pi (unplug and plug back in).
*   In your Raspberry Pi Imager settings, confirm that you clicked "Set username and password", and used the username `pioreactor`. If not, try [reinstalling the image](/user-guide/software-set-up#setting-up-your-raspberry-pi).
*   Are you on an older Windows machine? You may need to install a DNS [service](https://learn.adafruit.com/bonjour-zeroconf-networking-for-windows-and-linux/overview#microsoft-windows-914263-8), but also see workarounds [here](https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/octoprint-name-resolution-hacks).
