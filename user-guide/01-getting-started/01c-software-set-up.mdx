### Before you begin

You can expect the setup process to take 10-15 minutes.


:::info

Before you get started, you'll need to have the following:

1.  A Raspberry Pi (our list of preferred Raspberry Pis is [here](/user-guide/common-questions#what-raspberry-pi-hardware-can-i-use-i-see-raspberry-pi-1-2-3-4-a-b--zero---its-confusing))
2.  A blank microSD card, ideally 16GB size or larger.
3.  A suitable power cord for the Raspberry Pi. (If you look at the power rating, it should be about 5V and at least 2.25A).
4.  A computer with internet access and ability to read & write to a microSD card.

:::

### Setting up your Raspberry Pi


We'll start with an unused Raspberry Pi and empty microSD card (or we'll reformat the card later if not empty).

1. Download the [Pioreactor leader & worker image file](https://github.com/pioreactor/custopizer/releases/latest/download/pioreactor_leader_worker.zip).

:::info
What is an image file? It's a file that contains all the required software preinstalled on it, including an operating system and our custom Pioreactor software. The image will be placed on the microSD card.
:::

2. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) for your operating system and install it.
3.  Open the newly-installed Raspberry Pi Imager.
3.  Click **Choose OS**. Click on **Use custom** towards the bottom:
    ![Click "Choose OS"](/img/user-guide/choose-os.png)
    ![Select the "Use custom" option](/img/user-guide/use_custom_image.png)
    Select the downloaded Pioreactor image from step 1.
	
    ![In the local computer's directory, select the downloaded image](/img/user-guide/select_new_image.png)
4. Insert your microSD card to your computer. After your microSD card is recognized by your computer, click **Choose Storage** and select it.
    ![Click "Choose storage"](/img/user-guide/choose-storage.png)
5. Click the settings menu (Gear button in the bottom right).
	![Settings menu](/img/user-guide/rpi-click-settings.png)
    1. Check **Set hostname**. Input a unique name for this Pioreactor. Some names that we use for our first Pioreactor: `pioreactor1`, or `leader`, or `p1`.
    2. Check **Enable SSH**, and select **Use password authentication**.
    3. Check **Set username and password**. Enter the following:
        -   **username**: `pioreactor`
        -   **password**: `raspberry` (you can change the password later).
    4. Check **Configure wireless LAN** and enter your network name into SSID network name, WiFi password, and country.
	:::note
	Alternative: instead of trying to connect to a difficult-to-access network, like at a university that may not easily allow Raspberry Pi's, [there's a built-in solution for creating a local access point](/user-guide/local-access-point)).
	:::
	
    5. Change timezone to your local timezone.

Your settings should look like this: 

  ![Settings menu](/img/user-guide/rpi-imager-settings.png)

6.  Click **Save**.
8.  Click **Write**. Writing will take up to 5 minutes. Perfect time for a tea break.
7.  Once writing is complete, remove the microSD card, and place it (exposed copper side up) into the Raspberry Pi. The microSD slot is located on the PWM side of the Pioreactor, in the gap between the Raspberry Pi and the bottom faceplate. Reference the picture for the orientation.

	![Insert the microSD card](/img/user-guide/place-micro-sd-card.png)
8.  Plug in the power cord into your Raspberry Pi. LEDs onboard the Raspberry Pi should start to light up. After no more than **three minutes**, your Pioreactor HAT will briefly blink a blue LED, signifying it is ready.
    - Waited, but didn't see a blue LED blink? Try pressing on the onboard button, near the side labelled "PWM". If this lights up a blue LED, you're good to move on. Still not working? Try this install process again, or email us at hello@pioreactor.com.
9. After observing the blue LED flashing, navigate to [http://pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) in a web browser to visit the web interface. (Not working? See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below).
10. The Pioreactor is now ready for use! Follow [this guide](/user-guide/prepare-vial-for-cultures) to set up your first experiment.

## Adding workers to your cluster

#### Step 1. Install the worker software

1. Follow the same instructions above, but use a [Pioreactor Worker image](https://github.com/pioreactor/custopizer/releases/latest/download/pioreactor_worker.zip) instead.

:::note 
Choose a hostname that isn't currently being used in your cluster, ex: `worker1`, `worker2`, etc.
:::

2. After you have installed the worker image, and powered up the Raspberry Pi, connecting the new Pioreactor to your cluster is simple:

#### Step 2. Add to cluster using the UI

On the _Pioreactors_ page in the web interface, click the "Add new Pioreactor" button in the top right:

![Add new pioreactor](/img/user-guide/add_new_pioreactor.png)

Provide the chosen hostname of the new worker Pioreactor:

![Add new pioreactor modal](/img/user-guide/add_new_pioreactor_modal.png)



After a minute, the new Pioreactor should appear on the _Pioreactors_ and _Experiment Overview_ page. Refresh the page if it does not show up.

#### From the command line _(Alternative)_

On the leader's command line, the command `pio add-pioreactor <new name>` will connect the new Pioreactor to the cluster.

:::tip
We highly recommend running a [self-test](/user-guide/running-self-test) on all Pioreactors after your initial setup to detect any hardware bugs at this point. 
:::

## Troubleshooting

#### My Pioreactor keeps flashing the blue LED
On a successful start, the Pioreactor will flash its blue LED for about 4 seconds. If you observe the blue LED flashing for longer, something may be wrong. You can diagnose the problem by [counting the number of flashes observed](/user-guide/error-codes).



#### My RPi won't connect to my WiFi.

*   If you are on a restrictive WiFi network (like at a university), and wish to avoid the network, [creating a local access point](/user-guide/local-access-point) may be a better option.
*   Some Raspberry Pis can't connect to Wifi natively, and some Raspberry Pis can only connect to 2.4GHz connections. See table below: [![Rpi and wifi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)[](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)
*   You may have mis-typed your WiFi credentials. To fix this, you'll need to restart the image installation from the Raspberry Pi Imager.
*   If connecting to a 5GHz WiFi connection, you _need_ to supply a valid country code. See the list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-2/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 "Link to country codes on wikipedia")
*   Check out some other possibilities [here](https://community.octoprint.org/t/wifi-setup-and-troubleshooting/184#heading--troubleshooting).


#### I want to change the Pioreactor name on installation of leader

Easiest solution is to start over: reflashing the OS onto the microSD card will remove all previous data, and you can try again.

#### pioreactor.local in a web browser is not showing up

*   In your browser's address bar, add the `http://` infront of the url, like so: `http://pioreactor.local`.
*   The UI is hosted on **http**, not **http_s_**. Check if you are accessing `http` `://pioreactor.local`, and _not_ `https` `://pioreactor.local`.
*   Try accessing using the url `http://<the permanent name of your Pioreactor aka hostname>.local`
*   If you know your Raspberry Pi's IP, try `http://<IP address of your Raspberry Pi>`
*   When pressing the button on the HAT, does the blue LED show up? If not, installation may have failed. Try installing the image again, and double check the settings.
*   In your Raspberry Pi Imager settings, confirm that you clicked "Set username and password", and used the username `pioreactor`. If not, try [reinstalling the image](/user-guide/software-set-up#setting-up-your-raspberry-pi).
*   Are you on an older Windows machine? You may need to install a DNS [service](https://learn.adafruit.com/bonjour-zeroconf-networking-for-windows-and-linux/overview#microsoft-windows-914263-8), but also see workarounds [here](https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/octoprint-name-resolution-hacks).
