### Let's install your new Pioreactor

You can expect the setup process to take 10-15 minutes.


:::info

Before you get started, you'll need to have the following:

1.  A Raspberry Pi (our list of preferred Raspberry Pis is [here](/user-guide/common-questions#what-raspberry-pi-hardware-can-i-use-i-see-raspberry-pi-1-2-3-4-a-b--zero---its-confusing))
2.  A blank microSD card, ideally 16GB size or larger.
3.  A suitable power cord for the Raspberry Pi. (If you look at the power rating, it should be about 5V and at least 2A).
4.  A computer with internet access and ability to read & write to a microSD card.

:::

### Setting up your Raspberry Pi


We'll start with an unused Raspberry Pi and empty microSD card (or we'll reformat the card later if not empty).

1. Download the [Pioreactor Leader image](https://github.com/pioreactor/pioreactor/releases/latest/download/pioreactor_leader_worker.img.zip): this has all the required software preinstalled on it, including the latest version of Raspberry Pi OS and Pioreactor.
2. Download the [Raspberry Pi Imager](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/) for your operating system, install it and open the Raspberry Pi Imager.
3.  Click "Choose OS". Click on "Use custom" towards the bottom:
    ![Select the "Use custom" option](/img/user-guide/use_custom_image.png)
    Select the downloaded Pioreactor image from step 1.
    ![In the local computer's directory, select the downloaded image](/img/user-guide/select_new_image.png)
4. Connect your microSD card to your computer. Once your microSD card connected to your computer, select it under "Choose Storage".
5. Click the settings menu (Gear button in the bottom right).
  ![Settings menu](/img/user-guide/ctrlshiftx.png)

    1. Set hostname as the desired name of this Pioreactor. Some names that we use for our first Pioreactor: `pioreactor1`, or `leader`, or `p1`.
    2. Check "Enable SSH".
    3. Add username: `pioreactor` and password: `raspberry` (you can change the password later)
    4. Check "Configure wireless LAN" and enter your network name into SSID, wifi password, and country. (Alternative: instead of trying to use a "restrictive" network, like at a university that may not allow Raspberry Pi's, [here's a built-in solution for creating a local access point](/user-guide/local-access-point)).
    5. _(Optional)_ Change timezone to your local timezone.
    6. Click "Save"

6.  Click "Write".
7.  Once writing is complete complete, remove the microSD card, and place it into the Raspberry Pi.
8.  Plug in the power cord into your Raspberry Pi. LEDs onboard the Raspberry Pi should start to light up.
9.  After a few moments, your Pioreactor will briefly flash a blue LED, signifying it is ready. Navigate to [http://pioreactor.local](http://pioreactor.local) in a web browser to visit the web interface. (Not working? See [Troubleshooting](#troubleshooting) below).
10. The Pioreactor is now ready for use! Experiment preparation instructions can be found [here](/user-guide/prepare-vial-for-cultures). 


## Adding workers to your cluster

#### From the web UI

Follow the same instructions above, but use a [Pioreactor Worker image](https://github.com/pioreactor/pioreactor/releases/latest/download/pioreactor_worker.img.zip) instead. 

**Note**: Choose a hostname that isn't currently being used in your cluster, ex: `worker1`, `worker2`, etc.

After you have an installed the image, connected the new Pioreactor to your cluster is simple. On the _Pioreactors_ page in the web interface, click the "Add new Pioreactor" button in the top right:

Provide the chosen hostname of the new worker Pioreactor:

After a minute, the new Pioreactor should appear on the _Pioreactors_ and _Experiment Overview_ page (refresh the page if not showing up).

#### From the command line

On the leader's command line, the command `pio add-pioreactor <new name>` will connect the new Pioreactor to the cluster.

## Troubleshooting

#### My Pioreactor keeps flashing the blue LED
On a successful start, the Pioreactor will flash its blue LED for about 4 seconds. If you observe the blue LED flashing for longer, something may be wrong. You can diagnose the problem by [counting the number of flashes observed](/user-guide/error-codes).



#### My Rpi won't connect to my Wifi.

*   If you are on a restrictive WiFi network (like at a university), and wish to avoid the network, [creating a local access point](/user-guide/local-access-point) may be a better option.
*   Some Raspberry Pis can't connect to Wifi natively, and some Raspberry Pis can only connect to 2.4GHz connections. See table below: [![Rpi and wifi](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)[](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/884032/105118696-e945dd00-5a9c-11eb-91f5-0cc77cdc1422.png)
*   You may have mis-typed your Wifi credentials. To fix this, you'll need to restart the image installation from the Raspberry Pi Imager.
*   If connecting to a 5GHz wifi connection, you _need_ to supply a valid country code. See the list here: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO\_3166-1\_alpha-2/](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-1_alpha-2 "Link to country codes on wikipedia")
*   Check out some other possibilities [here](https://community.octoprint.org/t/wifi-setup-and-troubleshooting/184#heading--troubleshooting).


#### I want to change the Pioreactor name on installation of leader

Easiest solution is to start over: reflashing the OS onto the microSD card will remove all previous data, and you can try again.

#### pioreactor.local in a web browser is not showing up

*   The UI is hosted on **http**, not **http_s_**. Check if you are accessing `http` `://pioreactor.local`, and _not_ `https` `://pioreactor.local`.
*   Are you on an older Windows machine? You may need to install a DNS [service](https://learn.adafruit.com/bonjour-zeroconf-networking-for-windows-and-linux/overview#microsoft-windows-914263-8), but also see workarounds [here](https://github.com/OutsourcedGuru/octoprint-name-resolution-hacks).
*   Try instead `http://<the permanent name of your Pioreactor aka hostname>.local`
*   Still not working? Try instead `http://<IP address of your Raspberry Pi>`
