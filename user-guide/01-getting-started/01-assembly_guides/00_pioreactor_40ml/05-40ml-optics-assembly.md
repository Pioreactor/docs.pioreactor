1.  You will need both PD cables (dark bulbs) and IR cable (clear bulb). _Note that PD cables are now 3.5" long instead of 4"_. 

:::tip
Inspect each LED and PD to confirm that their leads are not touching each other.
:::

2.  Insert the connector of the <Highlight color={colors.magenta}>IR cable</Highlight> into **channel A** (labelled on the faceplate).
3. Insert the bulb of the IR cable into the **pocket labeled IR**. 
4. _Slowly_ bend the bulb's leads 90 degrees, as seen. 

:::caution
Avoid over-stressing the leads, or applying too much force too quickly. After bending once, it's ill-advised to bend them again. 
:::

5. Secure the bulb in place with an LED cap.

1. Plug the connector of <Highlight color={colors.red}>one PD cable</Highlight> into **channel 1**.
2. Insert the bulb of that cable into the **REF pocket**. 
3. _Slowly_ bend the bulb's leads 90 degrees, as seen.

:::caution
Avoid over-stressing the leads, or applying too much force too quickly. After bending once, it's ill-advised to bend them again.

4. Secure the bulb with an LED cap.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 3: Connect PD cable (90Â° â†’ Channel 2)" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/40ml/direction-of-pd-2.png", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/40ml/secure-90-bend-cable.png", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/40ml/completed-optics.png", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/40ml/40ml.png"]}>

1. Take a moment to orient the <Highlight color={colors.blue}>other PD cable</Highlight> such that it bends in the right direction for the black connector to insert into **channel 2**. See the image for more detail. 
2. In this orientation, **_but without connecting the cable to the channel_**, insert the bulb into the pocket labeled 90Â°. 
3. Bend the leads gently in the direction of the channel. 
4. Secure the bulb with an LED cap. 
5. Plug the connector into **channel 2**. 
6. Push all remaining LED caps onto each pocket.
