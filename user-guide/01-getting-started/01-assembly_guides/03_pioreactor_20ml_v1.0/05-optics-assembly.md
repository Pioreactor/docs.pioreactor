<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 1: Optic cables assembly" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/three_bulbs.jpg","user-guide/hardware-assembly/cable_channels.jpg"]}>

1.  You will need both <Highlight color={colors.blue}>PD cables (dark bulbs)</Highlight> and <Highlight color={colors.red}>IR cable (clear bulb)</Highlight>.
2.  Insert the connector of either <Highlight color={colors.blue}>PD cable</Highlight> into **PD channel 1** (labelled on the faceplate).
3.  Place the connector of the other <Highlight color={colors.blue}>PD cable</Highlight> into **PD channel 2**.
4.  Insert the connector of the <Highlight color={colors.red}>IR cable</Highlight> into **channel A** (labelled on the faceplate).

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 2: Inserting the bulbs into the vial holder" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/bulb_in_pocket.jpg", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/single_pocket_with_cap.jpg", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/ir_led_no_cap.jpg", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/ir_led_with_cap.jpg", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/ir_ref.jpg"]}>

1.  Insert the bulb of the PD cable in <Highlight color={colors.blue}>**channel 2**</Highlight> into the <Highlight color={colors.blue}>pocket labeled **90°**</Highlight>.
2. _Slowly_ bend the bulb's leads 90 degrees, as seen. Secure with a LED pocket cap.

   :::caution
   Avoid over-stressing the leads, or applying too much force too quickly. After bending once, it's ill-advised to bend them again.
   :::


3.  Insert the bulb of the IR cable in <Highlight color={colors.red}>**channel A**</Highlight> into the <Highlight color={colors.red}>pocket labeled **IR**</Highlight>.
4.  Bend the leads 90 degrees and secure with a LED pocket cap.
5.  Insert the bulb of the PD cable in <Highlight color={colors.green}>**channel 1**</Highlight> into the <Highlight color={colors.green}>pocket labeled **REF**</Highlight>. Orient the bulb's leads such that when bent 90 degrees, it does not interfere with the IR LED bulb next to it.
6. Bend the leads 90 degrees and secure with a LED pocket cap.

:::tip
Inspect each LED and PD to confirm that neither of the leads are touching.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 3: Add the rest of the LED caps" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/pockets_with_caps.jpg"]}>

1.  Push all remaining LED pocket caps onto each pocket.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 4: Add the window covering (optional)" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/window_screws.jpg","user-guide/hardware-assembly/window_placement.jpg", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/window_screwing.jpg"]}>

This window covering is optional. You can add it to further reduce the light in the bioreactor, or you may leave it off to inspect the culture.

1. You will need <Highlight color={colors.orange}>4x 6mm screws</Highlight>, and the <Highlight color={colors.green}>window cover</Highlight>.
2. Attach the window cover to the side of the vial holder using the screws.
3. Insert the glass vial into the Pioreactor. The vial should feel snug, but not very tight. If it feels too tight, try loosening the <Highlight color={colors.orange}>four 6mm screws</Highlight> slightly.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 4: Your done!" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/finished.jpg"]}>

1.  Your Pioreactor assembly is complete! 🚀
2.  Leave the Pioreactor powered off, for now.
3.  If you also have pumps, we'll assemble those later.
3.  Next: begin installing the [software](/user-guide/software-set-up).
