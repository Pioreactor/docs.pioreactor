<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 1: Necessary tools" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/rpi_types.jpg","user-guide/hardware-assembly/screwdriver.jpg"]}>

You will need the following items to assemble your Pioreactor:

1. Your own Raspberry Pi (RPi). Displayed are three examples.
2. A Philip's head screwdriver.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 2: Use all the information available to you" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/instructions.png", "user-guide/hardware-assembly/label_reference.jpg"]}>

- Before staring a step, read all instructions and view all photos at the bottom of each step
- Most of the labels are scaled 1:1 and can be used to identify parts.

<AssemblyInstructionBlock title="Step 3: Electronics protection" images={["user-guide/hardware-assembly/nav_antistatic_polyzip_bags.png"]}>

Here are some tips to prevent damage to the electronics:
- **Keep the electronics inside the ESD bag** right until you are asked to install them.
- **Always touch the sides of the board** while manipulating with it. Avoid touching the chips, capacitors, and other parts of the electronics.
- **Before you touch the electronics**, use any conductive (steel) structure nearby to neutralize any electro-static energy.
- **Be extra cautious in rooms with carpets**, which are a source of electrostatic energy.
- Clothes made of wool and certain synthetic fabrics can easily gather static electricity. It is safer to wear **cotton clothing**.
