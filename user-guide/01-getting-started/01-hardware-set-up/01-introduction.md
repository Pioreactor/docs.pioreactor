You will need the following tools to assemble your Pioreactor:

1. Your own Raspberry Pi (Rpi)
	*	Displayed are three examples
2. A Philip's head screwdriver
3. Needle-nose pliers

The hardware assembly is split into 4 pages, each targeting a different component of the Pioreactor. These include:
*	The heating PCB
*	The fan (or stirring) PCB
*	Cables with bulbs for optical density readings
*	The Raspberry Pi and HAT, which control everything above
*	The vial holder

:::tip
The 40 GPIO pins (standing for general-purpose input/output) form a distinct row on one side of the Rpi and HAT. Note the orientation of these pins to help you assemble correctly!
