title: Assembling the Raspberry Pi and the HAT

1. Depending on if you are using a Raspberry Pi Zero (the tinier Raspberry Pi), or Raspberry Pi A or B (the full and 3/4 size), the placement of the nuts will be slightly different. See below:

import Tabs from '@theme/Tabs';
import TabItem from '@theme/TabItem';

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="a_or_b" label="Raspberry Pi A or B">
    This is an orange üçä
  </TabItem>
  <TabItem value="zero" label="Raspberry Pi Zero" default>
    This is an apple üçé
  </TabItem>
</Tabs>


2. Next, place your Raspberry Pi on top of the screws, with the GPIO pins nested into the indent.

3. Screw in the 12mm hex standoffs + screws into each of the four corners.

4. The Pioreactor HAT goes on next. The HAT's GPIO insert will line up with the RPi's GPIO pins, and may require a slight force to compress down. Careful note to apply too much force and bend any pins.

3. Screw in the 10mm hex standoffs into each of the four corners.

4. You can put this aside for now. Next, we'll assembly the wetware.
