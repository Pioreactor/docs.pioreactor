# Supplying external power to the Pioreactor

Some applications require more power to your Pioreactor. This may include using a more powerful pump, more powerful LEDs, or if your Pioreactor is heavily using lots of peripherals.

If you see warning messages that reference under voltage or throttling, you probably are asking the Pioreactor to do too much given its default power supply. You'll need to supply a higher voltage / amp power, using the barrel jack connection. The barrel jack connection allows for power supply units of up to 18V.

:::caution
When changing the default power supply (5V) to something else, your stirring calibration, pump calibrations, and heating calibration will need to be updated.
