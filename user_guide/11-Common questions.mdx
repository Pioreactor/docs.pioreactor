Optical density and LEDs
------------------------

### Why does the intensity for LED A turn on & off?

You may have noticed that the LED labelled A turns on & off every 5 seconds or so. This is (normally) the channel for the infrared (IR) LED, which is used in the optical density measurements. Since we only take reading every 5 seconds (normally, this can be changed), we don't need the IR LED on all the time. The Pioreactor will only turn on LED when needed. This preserves the strength of the LED over longer periods of time. For more advanced use cases, it also allows other optical measurements to take place without the IR LED interfering with them.

### Why does my optical density flatten, or even decrease? What is a saturation point?

For some experiments, especially when using a scatter angle of 135Â°, you may notice that the optical density starts to flatten, and even decrease, _when you know the culture should still be growing_. This is not a property of the culture, but occurs because the culture is getting too dense, and light is now being interrupted before it reaches the photodiodes. Prior to this point, called the saturation point, the relationship between culture density and optical density is nearly linear. But after this point, there is a flattening, even negative, relationship between culture density and optical density. For all analysis, we recommend only studying when the culture is in the linear regime. You can mitigate the problem by choosing a smaller scatter angle (like 90Â° or 45Â°), diluting the culture using an automation like the turbidostat, or using a lower concentration of nutrient(s) in the media.

### What does the effect of the scatter angle have on optical density?

The scatter angle is the angle between the IR LED and a photodiode. This angle can be 45Â°, 90Â°, or 135Â°  (although 180Â° is possible, we don't consider it here). What is there to consider when choosing an angle. In general, the trend is shorter angles => less sensitive at low densities, but higher saturation point. By default, we suggest 45Â° as a good trade off between sensitivity and saturation. You can mix angles, and the Pioreactor's internal algorithm will still combine them into a single growth rate.

Raspberry Pi Hardware
---------------------

### What Raspberry Pi hardware can I use? I see Raspberry Pi 1, 2, 3, 4, A, B, +, Zero - it's confusing!

We've designed the hardware and software to be compatible with any Raspberry Pi that has onboard Wifi. That includes (at the time of writing):

*   Raspberry Pi 3
*   Raspberry Pi 3 B+
*   Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+
*   Raspberry Pi 4 B
*   Raspberry Pi Zero W (with header) \*
*   Raspberry Pi Zero 2 W

Although you can use any above, we like the Raspberry Pi 3 Model A+ because of its low power consumption, slim build, and low price. It has the necessary CPU power and memory for the Pioreactor workload, and is generally the cheapest on the list above (see note on Zero W below).

**\*** _Raspberry Pi Zero W_ is on the list above, and is very low cost compared to the others. They can absolutely be used for Pioreactors _as workers_ - we don't recommend them to be your _leader_ (note sure what these terms mean? Here's an introduction to [leader and workers](/Leaders-workers-and-inventory)). As workers, Raspberry Pi Zero W perform just fine, but will respond slower to commands. Note that this does not include the Raspberry Pi Zero _2_ W model, which is fine for all jobs.

### Do I need any cooling for the Raspberry Pi?

Nope, you shouldn't, unless you are connecting an external monitor.

### Could a Raspberry Pi-compatible board work, like Rock Pi 4?

Probably. We haven't tested them, but so long as i) the GPIO pins are identical, and ii) Raspberry Pi OS can be installed, it should work.

### Why are the Raspberry Pi LEDs/USB/Ethernet/etc. turned off?

We turn off the "activity" LED (usually the green one) to save some power for the Pioreactor's peripherals. We do the same for USB and Ethernet. You can turn these back on by editing the /boot/config.txt file on the Rpi.

Data storage, access and recovery
---------------------------------

> ðŸ’¡ For any important project, we suggest manually exporting or backing up critical data multiple different places. This doesn't just apply to using the Pioreactor, but is good advice in general.

### Where are logs stored?

For the logs that you see in the Log Table in the _Experiment Overview_ page, these can be download on the _Download experiment data_ page in the Pioreactor web interface. Other logs are also available, including dosing event and algorithm change-logs.

More granular logs per Pioreactor are available in `/var/log/pioreactor.log` on the Raspberry Pis.

### How do I access raw experiment data?

1.  The _Download experiment data_ page in the Pioreactor web interface provides CSV exports of common datasets from a pre-selected experiment.
2.  All data eventually lands in a SQLite3 database on the leader Pioreactor, by default located in `/home/pi/.pioreactor/storage/pioreactor.sqlite`. This can be download using a tool like `scp`.

### My microSD card is corrupted - what can I do?

Unfortunately, the microSD card becoming corrupted or damaged is an infrequent but possible risk with using Raspberry Pis. - If the microSD card was inside a non-leader, it's best to try to reformat the microSD card and start fresh (i.e. [reinstall the Pioreactor software and reintroduce it to the cluster](/Installation#adding-workers-to-your-cluster)). This is usually okay as no critical data is stored locally in workers, except for some log files. - If the microSD was inside the leader Raspberry Pi, this is a bigger problem. Likely any running experiment will have to be restarted. Fortunately, if you have more than one Pioreactor other than the leader, then the leader's SQLite database has been periodically backing itself up to other Pioreactors every few days. Using the command line, check other Pioreactors' `/home/pi/.pioreactor/storage` directory for the _latest_ backup named `pioreactor.sqlite.backup` (should be from within the past few days hours). You can use this database to restart a new leader.
