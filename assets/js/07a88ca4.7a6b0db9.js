Explore the sidebar for experiments you can perform with your Pioreactor. We encourage you to expand on the sample protocols we provided using your own cultures and media.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Research and beyond/directed-evolution-salt-tolerance":{"id":"Research and beyond/directed-evolution-salt-tolerance","title":"Directed evolution of salt-tolerant yeast","description":"Use a turbidostat system with selective pressures to study evolutionary principles. Turbidostats remove and add salted media periodically, so cultures grown in this environment will become salt-tolerant over time. Once your culture has acclimated, inoculate new vials to compare the newly-grown salt-tolerant strain to the wild type strain.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Research and beyond/temp-cycle":{"id":"Research and beyond/temp-cycle","title":"Temperature cycling of continuous cultures","description":"Apply turbidostat functions with temperature cycling. We created a plugin that cycles the temperature between 30\xb0C and 40\xb0C sinusoidally over a 24 hour period. Together with turbidostat media cycling, the maximum specific growth rate can be characterized between a culture held at a static temperature versus a culture undergoing temperature cycling. This experiment explores concepts described in Knutson et al., (2018).","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary level education/amylase-enzyme":{"id":"Secondary level education/amylase-enzyme","title":"Starch digestion using amylase","description":"Explore the enzymatic activity of amylase as it breaks down starch (a complex carbohydrate) into simple sugars. Amylase is an enzyme derived from a variety of living-sources. A starch slurry (a combination of water and starch) can be created and the addition of amylase will convert the starch into glucose, resulting in a translucent sugar water. Concentrations and effects of inhibitors can be explored. In this example, we will use black tea.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary level education/salt-stress-on-yeast":{"id":"Secondary level education/salt-stress-on-yeast","title":"Osmotic pressure induced by salt","description":"The addition of salt in media causes growth stress for yeast. Classes can quantify the linear differences in growth rate over time as salt content increases.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary level education/yeast-ferment-different-ph":{"id":"Secondary level education/yeast-ferment-different-ph","title":"Yeast fermentation at different pH levels","description":"Demonstrate how environmental pH levels can affect the growth rate of yeast. Students can explore pH scales and how this relates to the process of fermentation, which is the process in which microorganisms (like yeast) break down sugars into energy sources for its own use. Changes in pH can ultimately affect the growth ability of yeast. Baker\u2019s yeast thrives in a pH range of 4 to 6, and growth can be inhibited in pH levels outside this range.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary level education/yeast-growth-by-temperature":{"id":"Secondary level education/yeast-growth-by-temperature","title":"Yeast growth at varying temperatures","description":"Demonstrate the effect of temperature on yeast growth. Students may have a prior belief that temperature effects are linear, ex: a culture at 10\u2103 will grow at half the rate compared to a culture at 20\u2103, and a third the rate at 30\u2103. This experiment would show the non-linear effect of temperature on growth (and relate it to how refrigerators halt spoilage for so long). Students and the teacher can pick temperatures to test beforehand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary level education/yeast-in-ethanol":{"id":"Secondary level education/yeast-in-ethanol","title":"Yeast growth in ethanol","description":"Ethanol, along with carbon dioxide, are waste products of yeast fermentation. High concentrations of ethanol can inhibit yeast cell division and growth. Students can explore the ethanol fermentation process and practice dilution calculations for media preparation. We\'ve included two methods to calculate ethanol precentages; teachers can prepare this beforehand or allow their students to calculate it themselves.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary level education/yeast-nutrient-enrichment":{"id":"Secondary level education/yeast-nutrient-enrichment","title":"Yeast nutrient enrichment","description":"DME + YL or just DME in a turbidostat system.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"University level education/algae-day-night-cycle":{"id":"University level education/algae-day-night-cycle","title":"Algae day and night cycles","description":"Adding two LED bulbs onto your base Pioreactor will create a photo-bioreactor, giving you the ability to grow species that require light!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"University level education/continuous-cultures-using-turbidostat":{"id":"University level education/continuous-cultures-using-turbidostat","title":"Continuous cultures using a turbidostat","description":"Your Pioreactor can be transformed into a turbidostat, where pumps are used to replenish media around a target OD, creating a continuous culture. Due to the abundance of resources and lack of rate-limiting nutrients, the specific growth rate of a species is maximized. Learn more about the differences in bioreactor strategies here.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"University level education/yeast_strain_comparisons":{"id":"University level education/yeast_strain_comparisons","title":"Yeast strain comparisons","description":"","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
