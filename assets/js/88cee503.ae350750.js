Amylase is an enzyme derived from a variety of living-sources. A starch slurry (a combination of water and starch) can be created and the addition of amylase will convert the starch into glucose, resulting in a translucent sugar water. Concentrations and effects of inhibitors can be explored. In this example, we will use black tea.","permalink":"/experiments/amylase-enzyme"}],"allTagsPath":"/experiments/tags"}')}}]);
