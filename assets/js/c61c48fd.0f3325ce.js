Students may have a prior belief that temperature effects are linear, ex: a culture at 10\u2103 will grow at half the rate compared to a culture at 20\u2103, and a third the rate at 30\u2103. This experiment would show the non-linear effect of temperature on growth (and relate it to how refrigerators halt spoilage for so long). Students and the teacher can pick temperatures to test beforehand.","permalink":"/experiments/yeast-growth-by-temperature"}],"allTagsPath":"/experiments/tags"}')}}]);
