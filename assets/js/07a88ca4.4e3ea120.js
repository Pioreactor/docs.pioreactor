Students can explore pH scales and how this relates to the process of fermentation, which is the process in which microorganisms (like yeast) break down sugars into energy sources for its own use. Changes in pH can ultimately affect the growth ability of yeast. Baker\u2019s yeast thrives in a pH range of 4 to 6, and growth can be inhibited in pH levels outside this range. Students can explore differences in yeast growth by adjusting the initial pH levels with an acid or base, and monitoring the growth rates using the Pioreactor.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/yeast-growth-by-temperature":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/yeast-growth-by-temperature","title":"Yeast growth at varying temperatures","description":"Demonstrate the effect of temperature on yeast growth. Students may have a prior belief that temperature effects are linear, ex: a culture at 10\u2103 will grow at half the rate compared to a culture at 20\u2103, and a third the rate at 30\u2103. This experiment would show the non-linear effect of temperature on growth (and relate it to how refrigerators halt spoilage for so long). Students and the teacher can pick temperatures to test beforehand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
