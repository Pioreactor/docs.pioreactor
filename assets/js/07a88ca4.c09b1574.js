Explore the sidebar for experiments you can perform with your Pioreactor.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/amylase-enzyme":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/amylase-enzyme","title":"Starch digestion using amylase","description":"Explore the enzymatic activity of amylase as it breaks down starch (a complex carbohydrate) into simple sugars. Amylase is an enzyme derived from a variety of living-sources. A starch slurry (a combination of water and starch) can be created and the addition of amylase will convert the starch into glucose, resulting in a translucent sugar water. Concentrations and effects of inhibitors can be explored. In this example, we will use black tea.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/salt-stress-on-yeast":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/salt-stress-on-yeast","title":"Osmotic pressure induced by salt","description":"Observe differences yeast cell viability by introducing osmotic pressures with increasing salt concentrations. This experiment explores the topic of hypo- and hypertonicity. Salty environments create osmotic pressure gradients across the cell membrane. This introduces cellular stress, resulting in differences in cell growth rates.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/yeast-ferment-different-ph":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/yeast-ferment-different-ph","title":"Yeast fermentation at different pH levels","description":"Demonstrate how environmental pH levels can affect the growth rate of yeast. Students can explore pH scales and how this relates to the process of fermentation, which is the process in which microorganisms (like yeast) break down sugars into energy sources for its own use. Changes in pH can ultimately affect the growth ability of yeast. Baker\u2019s yeast thrives in a pH range of 4 to 6, and growth can be inhibited in pH levels outside this range.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/yeast-growth-by-temperature":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/yeast-growth-by-temperature","title":"Yeast growth at varying temperatures","description":"Demonstrate the effect of temperature on yeast growth. Students may have a prior belief that temperature effects are linear, ex: a culture at 10\u2103 will grow at half the rate compared to a culture at 20\u2103, and a third the rate at 30\u2103. This experiment would show the non-linear effect of temperature on growth (and relate it to how refrigerators halt spoilage for so long). Students and the teacher can pick temperatures to test beforehand.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/yeast-in-ethanol":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/yeast-in-ethanol","title":"Yeast growth in ethanol","description":"Ethanol, along with carbon dioxide, are waste products of yeast fermentation. High concentrations of ethanol can inhibit yeast cell division and growth. Students can explore the ethanol fermentation process and practice dilution calculations for media preparation. We\'ve included two methods to calculate ethanol precentages; teachers can prepare this beforehand or allow their students to calculate it themselves.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Secondary and University level education/yeast-nutrient-enrichment":{"id":"Secondary and University level education/yeast-nutrient-enrichment","title":"Yeast nutrient enrichment","description":"Brewers wort is a sugary liquid extracted from the mashing process when making beer or whiskey. It contains vitamins and minerals necessary for yeast growth; yeast cells uptake these nutrients to produce proteins such as growth enzymes. Wort can be further supplemented with additional nutrients to enhance this growth. The one we have is designed for beer yeasts.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
