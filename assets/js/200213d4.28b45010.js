This is not a property of the culture, but occurs because the culture is getting too dense, and light is now being interrupted before it reaches the photodiodes. Prior to this point, called the saturation point, the relationship between culture density and optical density is nearly linear. But after this point, there is a flattening, even negative, relationship between culture density and optical density. For all analysis, we recommend only studying when the culture is in the linear regime. You can mitigate the problem by choosing a smaller scatter angle (like 90\xb0 or 45\xb0), diluting the culture using an automation like the turbidostat, or using a lower concentration of nutrient(s) in the media.

In general, the trend is shorter angles => less sensitive at low densities, but higher saturation point. By default, we suggest 45\xb0 as a good trade off between sensitivity and saturation. You can mix angles, and the Pioreactor's internal algorithm will still combine them into a single growth rate.
