Students can explore pH scales and how this relates to the process of fermentation, which is the process in which microorganisms (like yeast) break down sugars into energy sources for its own use. Changes in pH can ultimately affect the growth ability of yeast. Baker\u2019s yeast thrives in a pH range of 4 to 6, and growth can be inhibited in pH levels outside this range. Students can explore differences in yeast growth by adjusting the initial pH levels with an acid or base, and monitoring the growth rates using the Pioreactor.","permalink":"/experiments/yeast-ferment-different-ph"}],"allTagsPath":"/experiments/tags"}')}}]);
