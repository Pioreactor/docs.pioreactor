For example, continuous culturing, optical density reading, and stable temperatures are available out-of-the-box. However, the specifics and range of how people use bioreactors goes far beyond what we could ever cover. That\'s why Pioreactor has added a platform so that community members can make their own extensions and share them with others. We call these plugins.
