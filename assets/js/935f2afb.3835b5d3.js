These LEDs can be used as a light source for photosynthetic microbes, influence the environment of the microbes, as additional sensors, or improve existing sensors. The motivating example was for the Pioreactor to support algae growth, but we ended up solving a lot of additional problems by framing LEDs as automations, similar to how we have dosing automations","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/temperature-automations":{"id":"Automations/temperature-automations","title":"temperature-automations","description":"The heater in the Pioreactor wetware can be programmed to control the temperature of the vial in automated ways.
