This is called the command line interface (CLI). Log onto either the leader or worker and you can execute the following commands. Full options and up-to-date documentation are available with pio  --help.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Advanced/Flashing blue led":{"id":"Advanced/Flashing blue led","title":"Blue LED flashing & error codes","description":"When a Pioreactor successfully boots, the onboard blue LED will flash quickly for 2 seconds, and then stop. However, there are times when the Pioreactor encounters an error, and will use the LED to alert to you that something is wrong. By counting the number of short flashes (per cycle), you can diagnose what might be wrong.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Advanced/Setting up remote access to the web interface":{"id":"Advanced/Setting up remote access to the web interface","title":"Setting up remote access to the web interface","description":"If you would like to expose the web interface to view over the internet (no authentication is provided however), you can use a service like Ngrok to do so.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Advanced/Supplying external power":{"id":"Advanced/Supplying external power","title":"Supplying external power to the Pioreactor\'s PWM channels","description":"Some applications require more power to your Pioreactor if it is heavily using lots of peripherals. This may include using a more powerful pumps, more powerful external LEDs, etc. Or, if you see warning messages that reference under voltage or throttling, you probably are asking the Pioreactor to do too much given its default power supply.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Advanced/Using the StemmaQT Qwiic connector":{"id":"Advanced/Using the StemmaQT Qwiic connector","title":"Using the StemmaQT / Qwiic connector","description":"The Pioreactor HAT comes with a connector for the StemmaQT / Qwiic connector that can be used to attack additional hardware for your Pioreactor. See image below:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/Dosing Automations":{"id":"Automations/Dosing Automations","title":"Dosing Automations","description":"When pairing the Pioreactor with dosing pumps, there are new capabilities and experiments you can run. The Pioreactor is pre-programmed with the following dosing automations. In the below automations, values highlighted like so are configurable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/LED Automations":{"id":"Automations/LED Automations","title":"LED Automations","description":"LED automations are ways to control the 4 available LEDs in the Pioreactor. These LEDs can be used as a light source for photosynthetic microbes, influence the environment of the microbes, as additional sensors, or improve existing sensors. The motivating example was for the Pioreactor to support algae growth, but we ended up solving a lot of additional problems by framing LEDs as automations, similar to how we have dosing automations","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/Temperature Automations":{"id":"Automations/Temperature Automations","title":"Temperature Automations","description":"The heater in the Pioreactor wetware can be programmed to control the temperature of the vial in automated ways.

In either case, a Pioreactor needs to be assigned as a leader. The leader unit controls other Pioreactors (and that may include itself), stores the database, hosts the web interface, and is the interface between users and the hardware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Hardware calibrations":{"id":"Hardware calibrations","title":"Hardware calibrations","description":"Hardware calibrations serve as a method to get accurate performance from your Pioreactor.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Peristaltic pumps":{"id":"Peristaltic pumps","title":"Using a peristaltic pump with your Pioreactor","description":"Attaching the pump","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Pioreactor hardware set up":{"id":"Pioreactor hardware set up","title":"Pioreactor hardware set up","description":"Coming soon!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Preparing your bioreactor for cultures":{"id":"Preparing your bioreactor for cultures","title":"Preparing your bioreactor for cultures","description":"Coming soon!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Raspberry Pi set up and software installation":{"id":"Raspberry Pi set up and software installation","title":"Raspberry Pi set up and software installation","description":"Let\'s install your new Pioreactor","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Running a self-test":{"id":"Running a self-test","title":"Running a self-test","description":"It\'s advisable to run a self-test on your Pioreactor before experiments.

For example, continuous culturing, optical density reading, and stable temperatures are available out-of-the-box. However, the specifics and range of how people use bioreactors goes far beyond what we could ever cover. That\'s why Pioreactor has added a platform so that community members can make their own extensions and share them with others. We call these plugins. (Below is how to install plugins - if you are looking to create your own plugins, see here.)","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"}}}')}}]);
