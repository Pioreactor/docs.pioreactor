However, there are times when the Pioreactor encounters an error, and will use the LED to alert to you that something is wrong. By counting the number of short flashes (per cycle), you can diagnose what might be wrong.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Advanced/Setting up remote access to the web interface":{"id":"Advanced/Setting up remote access to the web interface","title":"Setting up remote access to the web interface","description":"If you would like to expose the web interface to view over the internet (no authentication is provided however), you can use a service like Ngrok to do so.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Advanced/Simple scripting with Python":{"id":"Advanced/Simple scripting with Python","title":"Writing Pioreactor scripts with Python","description":"This article isn\'t intended as a crash course in Python, or Pioreactor software, but some helpful ways to write small scripts for your Pioreactor.

This may include using a more powerful pumps, more powerful external LEDs, etc. Or, if you see warning messages that reference under voltage or throttling, you probably are asking the Pioreactor to do too much given its default power supply.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/Dosing Automations":{"id":"Automations/Dosing Automations","title":"Dosing automations","description":"When pairing the Pioreactor with dosing pumps, there are new capabilities and experiments you can run. The Pioreactor is pre-programmed with the following dosing automations. In the below automations, values highlighted like so are configurable.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/LED Automations":{"id":"Automations/LED Automations","title":"LED automations","description":"LED automations are ways to control the 4 available LEDs in the Pioreactor. These LEDs can be used as a light source for photosynthetic microbes, influence the environment of the microbes, as additional sensors, or improve existing sensors. The motivating example was for the Pioreactor to support algae growth, but we ended up solving a lot of additional problems by framing LEDs as automations, similar to how we have dosing automations","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Automations/Temperature Automations":{"id":"Automations/Temperature Automations","title":"Temperature automations","description":"The heater in the Pioreactor wetware can be programmed to control the temperature of the vial in automated ways.

In either case, a Pioreactor needs to be assigned as a leader. The leader unit controls other Pioreactors (and that may include itself), stores the database, hosts the web interface, and is the interface between users and the hardware.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Extending your Pioreactor/Hardware calibrations":{"id":"Extending your Pioreactor/Hardware calibrations","title":"Hardware calibrations","description":"Hardware calibrations serve as a method to get accurate performance from your Pioreactor.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Extending your Pioreactor/Peristaltic pumps":{"id":"Extending your Pioreactor/Peristaltic pumps","title":"Using a peristaltic pump with your Pioreactor","description":"Attaching the pump","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"Extending your Pioreactor/Using community-built plugins":{"id":"Extending your Pioreactor/Using community-built plugins","title":"Using community-built plugins","description":"The Pioreactor comes with a large set of functionality and behaviour to accomplish most projects. For example, continuous culturing, optical density reading, and stable temperatures are available out-of-the-box. However, the specifics and range of how people use bioreactors goes far beyond what we could ever cover. That\'s why Pioreactor has added a platform so that community members can make their own extensions and share them with others. We call these plugins.
